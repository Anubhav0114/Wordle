## Notes

As I already had basic knowledge of Android development I thought this project would be super easy for me but the first challenge I faced in this project was to work with a spannable class. I have never done that ever before so first I read about and then implemented it to show a string with different colors of letters . Also while making this project I explored the  confetti   animation which I have never used. This project introduced  these two super cool things to me in Android development.
